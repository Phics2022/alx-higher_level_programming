Python: More Classes
Python is a popular programming language that supports object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP is a paradigm that allows you to define classes that encapsulate data and methods that operate on them. Classes can also inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes, creating a hierarchy of types. OOP makes code more reusable, modular and maintainable.
