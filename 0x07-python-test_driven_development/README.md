Python: Test Driven Development
Test driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. TDD is a great way to ensure that your code is reliable, maintainable, and bug-free. It also helps you to write cleaner and more modular code, as well as to improve your coding skills. TDD is not only a technique, but also a mindset that encourages you to think about your code from the perspective of the user and the functionality, rather than the implementation details.
